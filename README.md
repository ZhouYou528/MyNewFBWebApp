*Demo: [here](https://gatorbook.herokuapp.com/)*

- Gatorbook is a web based social media application using Angular 6, Node.js and Express and MongoDB database([MEAN stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle))). This project is used only for the purpose of practicing coding skills.
- It was originally a [project](https://github.com/yummycoding/weLoveFaceBook) of four people back in 2017. In mid 2018, I decided to expand and update the project using the updated frameworks, add a lot of new functionalities and redesign the user interface. So I created this repo and code the project from scratch, thus the current project is built completely on my own and successfully deployed on heroku. It is still being maintained and new functionalities will be added. Please check out using the Demo link above.
- Designed interactive UI using [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/). Designed database services using [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). 
- Realized user sign in/up authentication using [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/). Realized making/deleting, checking, updating, liking, commenting posts, searching and adding/deleting friends, modifying personal profile etc.
- Applied test driven development. Implemented unit tests and e2e tests using Karma and Protractor. Deployed on Heroku with MLAB.
